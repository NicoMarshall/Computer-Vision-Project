# Computer-Vision-Project
Training a machine learning model to play rock, paper, scissors using a laptop camera.

**Milestone 1:** The ML model is created and trained on TeachableMachine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image). Four image classes were created (rock, paper, scissors, nothing) 
and given images from my webcam, corresponding to the object of the class, with approximately 50 images for each class.
This model will later be used to interpret user image input in the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
